# Introduction

This Rmarkdown document is for P8105 - Data Science 1, homework 1.

# Methods

We will be using Rmarkdown (within Rstudio), git, github as well as some packages from the `tidyverse`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The data for problem 1 come from penguins table in the `palmerpenguins` package:

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Problem 1

## Data description
Here is some basic information about the dataset:

The dataset contains information on various species of penguins from different islands, with measurements taken of key variables across several years. There are `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns, with the following variable names:
`r names(penguins)`. The species included are `r unique(penguins$species)` from the islands `r unique(penguins$island)`, and the years range from `r min(penguins$year)` to `r max(penguins$year)`.

The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)`.

## Plot
Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color points using the species variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help).

Export your first scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.

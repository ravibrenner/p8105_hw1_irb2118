# Introduction

This Rmarkdown document is for P8105 - Data Science 1, homework 1.

# Methods

We will be using Rmarkdown (within Rstudio), git, github as well as some
packages from the `tidyverse`.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

The data for problem 1 come from penguins table in the `palmerpenguins`
package:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Problem 1

## Data description

Here is some basic information about the dataset:

The dataset contains information on various species of penguins from
different islands, with measurements taken of key variables across
several years. There are 344 rows and 8 columns, with the following
variable names: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. The species included are
Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap from the islands Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream, and
the years range from 2007 to 2009.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

## Plot

Here is a scatter plot of flipper_length_mm vs. bill_length_mm:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm,
                     color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("species_scatter.png")
```

# Problem 2

Here is a data frame with some special variables, meant to demonstrate
how R treats different variable types in practice

``` r
df_demo <- tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  g0 = if_else(norm_samp > 0, TRUE, FALSE),
  char_vec = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J is the tenth letter"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("red","green","blue","red","red","blue","red","green","blue","blue"))
)
```

Attempting to take the mean of each variable, we get missing (NA) values
for the character vector and factor vector, since `mean()` only works
for numeric, integer, and logical types.

``` r
mean(df_demo$norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] -0.6438227

``` r
mean(df_demo$g0)
```

    ## [1] 0.2

``` r
mean(df_demo$char_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_demo$char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df_demo$factor_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_demo$factor_vec): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# alternatively could take the mean across all variables like this:
summarize(df_demo, across(everything(), mean))
```

    ## Warning: There were 2 warnings in `summarize()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `across(everything(), mean)`.
    ## Caused by warning in `mean.default()`:
    ## ! argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 1 remaining warning.

# Introduction

This Rmarkdown document is for P8105 - Data Science 1, homework 1.

# Methods

We will be using Rmarkdown (within Rstudio), git, github as well as some
packages from the `tidyverse`.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

The data for problem 1 come from penguins table in the `palmerpenguins`
package:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Problem 1

## Data description

Here is some basic information about the dataset:

The dataset contains information on various species of penguins from
different islands, with measurements taken of key variables across
several years. There are 344 rows and 8 columns, with the following
variable names: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. The species included are
Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap from the islands Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream, and
the years range from 2007 to 2009.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

## Plot

Here is a scatter plot of flipper_length_mm vs.Â bill_length_mm:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm,
                     color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

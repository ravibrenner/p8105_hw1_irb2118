# Introduction

This Rmarkdown document is for P8105 - Data Science 1, homework 1.

# Methods

We will be using Rmarkdown (within Rstudio), git, github as well as some
packages from the `tidyverse`.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

The data for problem 1 come from penguins table in the `palmerpenguins`
package:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Problem 1

## Data description

Here is some basic information about the dataset:

The dataset contains information on various species of penguins from
different islands, with measurements taken of key variables across
several years. There are 344 rows and 8 columns, with the following
variable names: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. The species included are
Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap from the islands Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream, and
the years range from 2007 to 2009.

The mean flipper length in mm is 200.9152047.

## Plot

Here is a scatter plot of flipper_length_mm vs. bill_length_mm:

``` r
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("species_scatter.png")
```

# Problem 2

Here is a data frame with some special variables, meant to demonstrate
how R treats different variable types in practice

``` r
df_demo <- tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  g0 = if_else(norm_samp > 0, TRUE, FALSE),
  char_vec = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J is the tenth letter"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("red","green","blue","red","red","blue","red","green","blue","blue"))
)
```

Attempting to take the mean of each variable, we get missing (NA) values
for the character vector and factor vector, since `mean()` only works
for numeric, integer, and logical types.

``` r
mean(pull(df_demo, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.08856496

``` r
mean(pull(df_demo, g0))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(df_demo, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_demo, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df_demo, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_demo, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Attempting to convert the logical, character, and factor variables to
numeric. This works for the logical value (1 for `TRUE` and 0 for
`FALSE`) and for the factor variable (R converted the 3 factors to
numeric values 1, 2, and 3). There isn’t anything clear to do with the
character vector, so R returns a vector of NAs. When we tried to take
the mean, R implicitly converted the logical vector to numeric and
returned that mean. For the character vector, it returned NA (since each
value was NA when converted to numeric). For the factor vector, the
`mean()` function also returned NA, since the numeric values returned by
`as.numeric()` are really just ordinal labels for the 3 factors and they
don’t have any intrinsic value, so it doesn’t make sense to return a
mean for those values.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df_demo, g0))
as.numeric(pull(df_demo, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(df_demo, factor_vec))
```

# Conclusion

This homework demonstrated some basic ways to use R to manipulate
dataframes and variables, using Rmarkdown inline text and code chunks.
